# pycrocosm

OSM Map server API 0.6 implemented using Django.

Installation is described for Linux Mint 18.2, but should work on similar systems like Debian, Ubuntu Xenial or later. You need to configure and initialize the PostGIS database using https://github.com/TimSC/osm2pgcopy (this functionality will eventually be moved into pgmap.)

   cd <src>

   sudo apt install git virtualenv python-pip swig g++ python-dev libpqxx-dev rapidjson-dev libexpat1-dev

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/TimSC/pycrocosm.git

   virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python pgmapenv

   source pgmapenv/bin/activate

   pip install django djangorestframework defusedxml psycopg2

   cd pycrocosm/pgmap/

   python setup.py install

   cd ..

   cp pycrocosm/settings.py.template pycrocosm.settings

Update pycrocosm.settings with details of your database. If you want to access the site from other computers, ALLOWED_HOSTS needs to be set as well. In production, change DEBUG to false and generate a new SECRET_KEY.

   python manage.py runserver

Depends on submodule https://github.com/TimSC/pgmap to handle the PostGIS database.
